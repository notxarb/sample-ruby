### Nanobox is awesome

Nanobox is a tool that allows developers to manage applications without having to manage dependencies installed on their machine. The only dependencies for Nanobox are [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). The dependencies are all installed within a virtual machine for the application. Developers no longer have to worry about having multiple versions of languages, databases, or other services installed. On larger projects with multiple developers, there is no need to worry if the environment is the same on each machine. When a developer is no longer working on a project, they can remove it, and all of its dependencies with one command.
